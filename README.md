# My Userscripts

I use these with [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net).

## Prisma BibTeX importer

[Prisma](https://prisma.research.se) doesn't support importing your publications into the system. This probably wastes thousands of man-hours and taxpayer SEK every year. With this userscript installed, you can just paste a BibTeX record into Prisma to auto-fill the fields. Use the "Generic BibTeX" citation style and "Create bibliography from item" to the clipboard for fast transfer from Zotero to Prisma.

## Remove ScienceDirect spam links

Elsevier adds links to random words on every published article (HTML version). For compulsive clickers, this is a real productivity killer. This userscript restores productivity.
